            <p>
                I'm Allison! I'm originally from the LA area, and I moved to Colorado in 2014 to climb mountains. So far, 
                I've climbed 21 of the 53 fourteeners in Colorado and I ultimately plan to bag them all! In summer, if I'm 
                not on a summit, I'm usually bouldering, running, or just hanging out in the mountains. I love animals, 
                but especially my animals, my pets are my kids. I went to school for costume and sound design originally, 
                and have always been design conscious and passionate about bettering the experience of the audience. 
                I've spent the last 10 years working as a live sound engineer for theater, concerts, and corporate events. 
                My background in entertainment production has trained me not only to have a strong sense of design, 
                but to be adaptable, quick on my feet, and able to tackle any challenge.
