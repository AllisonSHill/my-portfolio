            <p>I started a coding bootcamp in March 2019. When I graduated in January 2020, I had learned how to do a little bit of a
                lot of things, both front end and back end development. The bootcamp was focused in C# and .NET development, but my
                favorite part of the curriculum was the Javascript course.
                <br />
                I boosted up my Javascript skills through self-teaching, and as I read more into the front end development world, I
                was intrigued by how efficient the React library was. I took, and graduated, the Scrimba React Developer course, in
                May of this year (2020), and I've been working on building my React skills by creating a number of projects, and
                I've been getting back to my artistic roots with wanting to develop beautiful Apps as well.
